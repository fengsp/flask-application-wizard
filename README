Flask Application Wizard
========================

A script that can generate Flask Applications, inspired by 
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-extension-wizard.  Just make
sure to have Flask installed before running that script.  It will
prompt you for a few things and then generate the basic stuff.

If you have Sphinx installed, it can create Sphinx documentation.
(It will automatically set up the Sphinx themes as a Git submodule
if you are using Git.)

If you have Git or Mercurial installed, it can initialize a
repository, and add a link to the development version if you plan
to host it on Github, Gitorious, or Bitbucket.

By default, applications are listed as BSD licensed, but you can
select the MIT license or use a different license by selecting
"none" when the wizard asks.

Installation with a fresh virtualenv:

$ virtualenv env
$ . env/bin/activate
$ pip install Flask Sphinx
$ python make-flaskapp.py

Then follow the instructions.
